# DoubleCaps
A dead simple AutoHotkey script to prevent accidental capslock activation. Double tap capslock to enable, single tap to disable.

This way, capslock can still be easily enabled and disabled with a single finger, but acidental triggering from a stray tab or shift press is much less likely.

Has config options for timeout speed (default is 300ms between presses) and whether to beep when capslock is toggled (default is enabled).
